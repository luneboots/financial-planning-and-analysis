# FINANCIAL PLANNING AND ANALYSIS

This basic program [in progress] creates financial analysis based on generated data to conduct the following - 

# 1. Variance Analysis
Compare actual spending against budgeted amounts.
Identify over- or under-spending trends.

# 2. Trend Analysis
Review historical spending data to identify patterns over time.

# 3. Cost-Benefit Analysis
Quantify costs and benefits of different programs or investments. Helps to evaluate the return on investment (ROI) for spending decisions.

# 4. Forecasting
Develop future projections for planning purposes.

# 5. Break-Even Analysis
Calculate the point where revenue and costs balance to determine project viability.

# 6. Unit Cost Analysis
Determine the cost per unit of output to benchmark efficiency.

# 7. Allocation Analysis
Analyze how funds are distributed across departments, programs, or projects to ensure alignment with strategic priorities.

# 8. Spending Efficiency Analysis
Assess the relationship between inputs (spending) and outputs (results or impact).

# 9. Sensitivity Analysis
Test how changes in key assumptions (e.g., revenue, inflation rates) affect the budget.

# 10. Cash Flow Analysis
Monitor the timing and amounts of cash inflows and outflows to ensure liquidity and operational efficiency.

# 11. Rate of Utilization
Measure how much of the allocated budget has been used within a specific period.
Helps identify unspent funds or budget bottlenecks.

# 12. Budget-to-Actual Reconciliation
Regularly reconcile budgets with actual expenditures to ensure alignment.
Identifies discrepancies and potential misallocations.
